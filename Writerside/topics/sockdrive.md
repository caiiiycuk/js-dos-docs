# FAT Drives (sockdrive)

js-dos supports running larger programs like Windows 95/98 games, which require access to FAT drives. All js-dos users 
have access to read-only storage, allowing them to freely run such games.

For subscribed users, there's an additional benefit of write support. This means they can save their progress and even 
install new games under existing Windows 95/98 installations. With the write support, premium users can enjoy a more 
immersive experience by having the ability to save and modify their game data, making their gaming journey even more 
enjoyable and customizable.

**Disk cloning (fork)**

sockdrive acts as a repository of disks, allowing you to choose any available disk and make a copy of it. 
However, to do this, you need to be registered on the js-dos platform and have a subscription.

After successful authentication, you will see a list of all your disks.
