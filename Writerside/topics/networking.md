All js-dos users are able to enjoy these games using the Netherlands server, which is provided for free. 
However, due to the server's free nature, occasional lag may be experienced. To ensure a smoother and more seamless 
multiplayer experience, subscribed users have the privilege of selecting their preferred server for playing these games.
